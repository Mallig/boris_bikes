Project attempting to emulate the "boris bike" transport system

learning how to TDD
    RED - decompose user stories to find objectives
        - feature test, try and run a command the user will want to do
        - unit test, use the feature test error to write a *matching* failing unit test
    GREEN - write project code to pass the test, has objective been met?
    REFACTOR - clean up the code, make it readable.
